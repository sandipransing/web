Collect all rotating circles with the black ball. You can move the ball by drawing shapes with mouse and using physics. The ways of completing a level is only limited by your imagination and line limit. Complete 15 levels to unlock level editor. I recommend to lower your mouse sesitivity. P.S. This is the first game I ever made
