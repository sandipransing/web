The Tortoise svn client on windows is one of my favorite svn client.

I am working on ubuntu karmic koala from last one year.
There are kdesvn. smartsvn svn clients available on ubuntu but still
time havenâ€™t found any svn client as good as tortoise svn on windows.

Is there any alternative ???

Can tortoise svn client installation possible using wine utility package in ubuntu ??
