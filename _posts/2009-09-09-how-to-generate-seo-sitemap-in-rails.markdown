## What is sitemap ? 

Sitemap is nothing but a .xml file containing urls available on your website

It contains URL, last modified date, frequency of content change and priority ( between 0..1 )

## Why we need sitemap ? 

We can submit sitemap file to search engine. It will help them in analysing what urls on your site are available for crawling.

## What is xml pattern ? 
```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">

        <url>
           <loc>http://www.example.com/</loc>
           <lastmod>2005-01-01</lastmod>
           <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
           <priority>0.8</priority>
        </url>
       ...
       ...
    </urlset>
```
## What will be the path for sitemap ? 

**"www.example.com/sitemap.xml"**

#### Are we going to generate sitemap manually ? 

No... there is `mephisto sitemap plugin` and you can make can use it.
```
ruby script/plugin install http://svn.appelsiini.net/svn/rails/plugins/mephisto_sitemap/
```
#### Am i needed to generate to sitemap for each request ? 

No... we can generate it in background task daily basis.

#### How it will be accessed for request to sitemap ? 

We can define path to local file in routes

```
map.connect "sitemap.xml", :controller => :sitemap
```

```ruby
class SitemapController
  def index
    render "some local file path"
  end
  ...
```
