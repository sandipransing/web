I did my bachelor in Computer Engineering from PES Modern College of Engineering, Pune.

In July 2007, I started software development career in Java.

After few months passed, I heard about ruby and rails from my friend Mr. Haribhau Ingale and found interesting to learn and develop my carreer.

I started learning ruby from Internet, Blogs, Ebooks.

I am always thankful to Josh for giving me opportunity to learn and work on ruby on rails at my intial stage.
